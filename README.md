## Damage Item Comparator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Small application made to help compare different builds in different video games.

### How to use

Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/MateuszLubian00/DamageItemComparator/releases) and double click it to open, or alternatively launch it through a command line `java -jar itemCompare.jar`. Java 17 is required, while Java 20 or higher is recommended.

To build this app yourself, you need JavaFX SDK installed and properly set up. You can find the newest version on [Gluon HQ](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) website.

### Planned features

Application is still in an early version, so a lot of the features are missing. My plans for future releases include:
1. Custom formulas to apply bonus statistics.
2. Better interface responsiveness. 
3. Custom effects for items.
4. Creation of new items.
5. Creation of new enemies, and comparing against them in the same graphs. 
6. Setting up build sets consisting of multiple items.
